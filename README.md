### Key Points
1. Feature Selection P. 3
  * Two Recangle Diff
  * Three Rectangle Diff
  * Four Rectangle Diff
2. Learning Classification Functions P. 6
3. Cascade classifier P. 11 (Using AdaBoosting)
4. Training Algorithm for Cascade classifier P. 14
5. Image processing P. 18
 

## Will this become the Next Skynet 123.Alpha?


### Images for benchmarking

## Choosing Features for Classifiers


#### No Resize Images 
Use precentages

#### Train to optimize filters for 
Train 

## TODO:
1. Finish Classifier
2. Make Classifier Boostable
3. Implement Feature Selection 
4. Preprocess Training Data, create training data.
5. Combine Feature Selection With Special AdaBoost and Classifier
6. Profit
